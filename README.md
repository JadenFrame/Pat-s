Group Members: Keelie Johnson and Jaden Frame 
Keelie Johnson: As the group leader, I oversaw the coding and fixed most of the problems that came up. I was the main communicator between the group and the client.
Jaden Frame: As the coder, I determined the main layout of the project and made the images for the menus in Canva. 
This website, while not the best, turned out to be an interesting and fun experience. We were able to see the work that goes into making what we see everyday when we decide to visit a website for information or for fun. Being able to experience making a website first hand turned out to be a bit more difficult than what was first imagined but it only served to heighten the challenge that most of us joined this class for.
