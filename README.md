Keelie Johnson 
  I am the leader of this project. I oversaw the coding and fixed some most of the problems. I fixed the images and made some of them.

   I am the main code person. I did have some problems but Keelie fixed them pretty fast. I made the theme and the menue images. I discoverd that i like creating websites and codeing them.
